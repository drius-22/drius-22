### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior undergraduate student working towards an Honours B.Sc. in Physics and Computer Science, with Engineering background and experience in Research and Software Development. 


## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on  
- Developing a spectral reduction pipeline for CHIRON, a high-resolution echelle spectrograph.
- Developing software to automate the structural drafting using the REVIT API.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 
- Algorithms for UAV three-dimensional path planning
- Algorithmic trading


## ðŸ’¬ Drop me a line with something new about science or computers 

## âš¡ Fun fact:  Only 8% of the worldâ€™s currency is physical money, the rest only exists on computers.
