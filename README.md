### Hi 👋

I'm a senior undergraduate student working towards an Honours B.Sc. in Physics and Computer Science, with Engineering background and experience in Research and Software Development. 


## 🔭 I’m currently working on  
- Developing a spectral reduction pipeline for CHIRON, a high-resolution echelle spectrograph.
- Developing software to automate the structural drafting using the REVIT API.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning 
- Algorithms for UAV three-dimensional path planning
- Algorithmic trading


## 💬 Drop me a line with something new about science or computers 

## ⚡ Fun fact:  Only 8% of the world’s currency is physical money, the rest only exists on computers.
